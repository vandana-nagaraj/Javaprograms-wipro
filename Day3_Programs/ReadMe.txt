final keyword :

Final variables :  can be assigned only once , If it's a reference(object or array),
the reference can't change , but the object's state may change.

Final Methods : Cannot be overridden by subclasses - used when you want to preserve
the behaviour(actions), Final methods can be overloaded ( because it is defined in same class)

Final Classes :  Cannot be subclassed  , useful for immutablility/security (eg. java.lang.String is final)

blank finals :  must be assigned exactly once , usually within the constructors or 
static initializers  -- useful , for ensuring constants  

this Keyword:
1) It refers to the current object instance
2) used inside instance methods/constructors to 
distinguish the ambiguity between instance variables and local variables if they have same name.
3) also used to call another constructor in the same class

Rule : Cannot be used in static block or context
class Hello{

int id ;
String name;

Hello(int id , String name)
{

this.id = id;
System.out.println(id);
System.out.println(this.id);

}


}


Transient Keyword:
Java Serialization : (Serialize and Deserialize) --> Converting the object to bytes  and deserialize it back from bytes to object
(Encrypting and Decrypting)
So while serialize and deserizable if you want certains attributes like passwords , security tokens should not be saved or should be regenerated or a part of it there we use transient keyword


instanceof  -  generally we use or checks at the time of type casting from object class to a particular class (Employee or Student) 
runtime type safety 

ArrayList<Student> ar = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<Employee> ar = new ArrayList<>();

It returns true if object is an instance of the class otherwise it gives false
It is safe before type casting


Inner Class : A class defined within the another class

Class Hello
{

class Message
{


}


}

Non-static member inner class  :  inner class can access all outer members (including private )  The inner class object needs to be tied with outer class object
Static Nested class: can access only static member of outer class , No need to tied with outer class object ( based on Builder pattern)
Local inner class : defined inside  a method , can access local variables that are final 
Anonymous Inner Class : Functional Interface : unnamed , inline class that implements an interface or extends a class 


OOPS : -Object Oriented Programming -- Real world

Class and Object  -- state  -- ( attributes)  --- behaviour --- ( functions)
RV

Employee e  = new Employee();

OOPS features  - Main Pillars
a) Abstraction   ---   It is implemented using Abstract Class or an Interface 
b) Polymorphism  ---   It is implemented using Run time polymorphism(Overriding) or Compile Time Polymorphism(Overloading)
c) Encapsulation ---    It is implemented using the private variables where direct accessibility is not given but we provide getter or setter methods  as per the requirement
d) Inheritance  --     It is implemented using extends keyword when child class inherit the base class


Encapsulation  -- when we focus on the data security,  

private int age = 30;  anyone can change or modify data without any rule ( no data restriction , no validation)

// Create an Encapsulated Employee class having fields as id, name and salary , 
//set the salary where the logic is that salary should be below 50000 while setting
//Apply trim on name input and display employee info 

Uses:-

Data Security  -- Protecting data or hiding internal state  and requiring all interaction due to public getter/setter methods
               -- Also controlled accessibility either getter( for reading only) or setter(for writing only ) or both getter/setter(Reading & Writing)

Polymorphism : Means many forms   
It allows one interface or method name to behave differently based on the object it's acting upon

decision of calling the method depends upon the object which will be decided either at compile time or run time
1) Method Overloading -- Static Binding -- (Compile time that which method will be called)  --- Same method in same class but different parameters
2) Method Overriding  -- Dynamic Binding -- (At run time it will be called either the parent one or the child one depends upon the creation of object)   --- Same method in base class and child class where child class  may redefine the parent's class method
 

polymorphism uses :

1. Code reusability  
2. Extensibility  -- Easy to add new behaviour or features without rewriting
3. Loose Coupling -- Works with base types of classes
4. Run time flexibility : At run time decision

Encapsulation (data hiding by wrapping the data members & member functions) & Abstraction (code/ Business Logic -  implementation hiding) --- Hiding 


Abstraction -- Abstract & Interface

Hiding the implementation and showing the necessary/relevant information -- What is an object 

Abstract classes are not 100% abstraction  --- we are implementing using abstract keyword : In abstract class we have both abstract methods as well as 
non abstract method --  where implementation/definition of abstract methods will be given by child class while overriding the abstract methods which is mandatory to override the abstract methods
and overriding is not mandatory for non abstract methods
//Amazon                                                                    Zara (.net/java (api for paymentProcessing))
abstract class Payment{
            
           private int years = 2;
           
           public int getYears()
           {
           return years;
           }
                                                                               class ProductPayment extends Payment
//abstract method  --  (methods declared without an implementation)              
abstract void paymentProcessing() ;                                            {  // Zara has to give the implementation or definition of paymentProcessing method because it is abstract   }

   // api -- call  (hidden implementation)

//non -abstract method
void discount()
{
// we can give the definition
 
}

}


interface --- (100% abstraction) --we are implementing using interface keyword  where all methods are by default abstract  (but before java 1.8) because after 1.8 onvwards we do have static or default methods for extension( as in functional interface)-- 

It's an agreement/contract where the implementation of all methods of an interface will be given by a child class and by default the variables in an interface are final
Interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction

Inheritance : where a child class inherits properties and methods from parent(super ) class using the extends keyword
              and it enables code reuse , hierarchical structure and also support polymorhism.
              
Types of Inheritance:
a) Single INheritance : one child(sub or derived class) and one parent(super ,base class)

for eg :  class Father{}     ,   class Child extends Father {}
b) Multilevel Inheritance : one child class extends one base class and then the another child class extends the child class

for eg :  class Father{}   , class Child extends Father{} ,   class GrandChild extends Child{}

c) Multiple Inheritance ( which is implemented via Interface) --  one class can implements two interfaces

for eg:   interface Operations{} , interface Execution{}   ,  class MainProgram implements Operations, Execution

* Second ex. is not possible :  class Father{}   , class Child extends Father{} ,   class GrandChild extends Father , Child 
* Third  ex. is possible : class Father{}   , interface Operations{} ,   class Child extends Father implements Operations {}
* Fourth ex. is not possible : class Father{}   , interface Operations{} ,   class Child implements Operations extends Father {}
* Fifth  ex. is possible:   interface Operations{} , interface Execution extends Operations{}   

d) Hierarchical Inheritance  : --  When multiple subclasses extending one same Parent 

for eg :  class GrandFather{}   , class Father extends GrandFather{} ,   class Child extends GrandFather{}

e) Hybrid Inheritance  --- Mix of types  eg : Hierarchical + interface based multiple inheritance

Super keyword is used in inheritance generally 
1. Super keyword is used to access the parent class fields or methods when overridden in child class  (super.field or super.method() you are calling in child  class of base class)
2. Super keyword  must be the first statement in the subclass constructor if used.
3. A subclass inherits only non-private or protected members of a base class.
4. super can't be used in static context.


Inheritance case study : E-commerce

We have different entities class : 

Single Inheritance :  Order ---> OnlineOrder  ( where regular order becomes a specialized online order that adds a tracking number)
Multilevel Inheritance  -- > User ---> Customer ---> PremiumCustomer (where user becomes a customer , and a customer can become a premium customer with some cashback)
Hierarchical Inheritance --->  Product(root category)--> Electronics  , Grocery ( where different types of product iherit common product features)
Interface based Multiple Inheritance  --- Discountable , Taxable ( products can implements two interface one is Discountable and another is Taxable)
Hybrid inheritance --- Product ---> Clothing  + Discountable ( where a class Clothes extends another class Product  and implementing the interface )
